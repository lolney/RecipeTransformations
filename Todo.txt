TODO:
- Ingredient replacement (in instructions and ingredients)
- Front-end for recipe replacement
	- Store parsed recipe as javascript object
	- update via ajax
- More work on instruction
	- May want to consider putting various meat categories under a single category, removing meals and entrees
	- May want to include searching in multiple categories if a conclusive result not found
	- Will definitely want to include another category based on nutritional content (since diets exclude whole food groups)
- Subtle improvements:
	- Try to replace descriptor first?
	- No duplicates - if multiple ingredients in a category, get the second, third best
	- Changing the name of the recipe?

In progress:
- Ingredient parsing 
- Instruction parsing
- Low-calorie, low-sodium lookups
- Transformation model
 	- Just need to include healthy lookups

Done:
- Getting recipe probabilities for ingredients (essentially)
- Ingredient classification (USDA part)
