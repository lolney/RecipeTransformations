TODO:
- Ingredient replacement (in instructions and ingredients)
- More work on instruction
	- May want to consider putting various meat categories under a single category, removing meals and entrees
	- May want to include searching in multiple categories if a conclusive result not found
	- Will definitely want to include another category based on nutritional content (since diets exclude whole food groups)

	- Might be easier just to include food-group -> food-group lookup table for diets
- Subtle improvements:
	- Try to replace descriptor first?
	- Changing the name of the recipe?
	- u'descriptor': u'beef round steak , cut into thin'
	- http://127.0.0.1:8080/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fallrecipes.com%2FRecipe%2FLighter-Mexican-Meatloaf%2F
- UI improvements?
	- show old ingredients?
	- add a footer
- Units from USDA site

In progress:
- Ingredient parsing 
- Instruction parsing
- Low-calorie, low-sodium lookups
- Transformation model
 	- Just need to include healthy lookups

Done:
- Getting recipe probabilities for ingredients (essentially)
- Ingredient classification (USDA part)
