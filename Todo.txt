TODO:
- Ingredient classification (spices, protein, etc.)
- Transformation model (doing lookups in the ingredients database, figuring out what needs to get replaced (whether quantity gets changed, etc.), and reflecting changes in the front-end)

In progress:
- Ingredient parsing
- Instruction parsing
- Getting recipe probabilities for ingredients 
- Low-calorie, low-sodium lookups
