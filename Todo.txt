TODO:
- Transformation model (doing lookups in the ingredients database, figuring out what needs to get replaced (whether quantity gets changed, etc.), and reflecting changes in the front-end)


In progress:
- Ingredient parsing 
	- something that might help: looking up items in db to see if name exists
- Instruction parsing
 	- breaking up steps into ingredients, tools, methods, times
	- donâ€™t actually have to do prep steps/cook steps?
- Low-calorie, low-sodium lookups


Done:
- Getting recipe probabilities for ingredients (essentially)
- Ingredient classification (spices, protein, etc.)
	- Just waiting for API to start working
